								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Portfoliopic.jpg" width="800" height="500" /></span>
								<p> </p>
								<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
								<p> <font size ="-1"></font>I am Adam Mansour, an energetic, upbeat, hardworking, entrepreneurial, and technology driven student. I am currently researching methods of validation for VLSI systems, as an undergraduate Computer Science research student at the University of South Florida. I am seeking internships or co-op opportunities in software development, engineering, research, maintenance, and testing.</a>.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Education</h3>
								<p>I am in my third semster at USF, I am going to graduate early in the fall of 2024 since I have taken almost a full year of dual enrollment credits at pasco-hernando state college while in high school.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Ideal Position</h3>
								<p><font size ="-1"></font>My ideal position would be one that allows me to evolve and grow as a Software Engineer, by using analytical skills in order to accomplish tasks efficiently across all spectrums from budget awareness, product optimization and taking calculated risk. This will enable me to gain an understanding and exposure of technologies used by engineers throughout the world, to enhance my potential as a software engineer.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Work Habits and Tendencies</h3>
								<p>I enjoy challenges, brainstorming, designing, and building anything comes to me as second nature! Whiteboarding code and trying to discover, design and building a solution fascinates me and enchances my problem solving ability. </p>
								<h3 class="major">Current SWE Focuses</h3>
								<p>I am really fond of AI, ML, and particularly enjoy VLSI Design. As a research student, I have been working on research methods for formal vericiation to validate VLSI Systems with a PHD enabled team. </p>
								<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
								<p>In conclusion, I believe that I have the ability to be an asset at any company I work for. My problem solving and efficient analytical skills have greatly benefited every team I have worked for or led and will continue to do.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Hobbies</h3>
								<p>My side hobbies include playing tennis, running, exercising in the gym, playing instruments, taking care of my two cats</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Bluetooth.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 class="major">Project-1 Bluetooth Receiver</h3>
								<p>In the picture above, you can see a bluetooth surround sound system receiver, converted for use as a two channel audio amplifier - receiver. I created this after I purchased surround sound speakers that were only capable of transmitting audio via aux cable, which was very annoying!</p>
								<h3 class="major">Project-2 3D Z3 SAT/SMT solving</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/z3logo.jpg" width = "500" height="500" /></span>
								<p>Z3 is a python library which was developed at Microsoft Research it is a theorem developer, which can be used for many applications<br> Examples: Software/hardware verification and testing, constraint solving, analysis of hybrid systems and security.<br> After joining The SEES lab at USF as a research student,<a href="https://github.com/madome03/Z3_Practice_and_Games/tree/main/Examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I began exploring the Z3 Library</a> during May of 2022, and was fascinated by it's capabilties. I was able to solve simple and difficult riddles whilst also being able to solve arithmetic and geometric math problems<br> Now, I have focused my research on the process of testing, verification, and validation of software, hardware, and embedded systems. My research specifically focuses on Bounded Model Checks which helps us <a href="https://github.com/sees-usf/BMC-Z3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automate the verification techniques </a> needed in order for multi thread programs to run and cooperate efficiently via SAT/SMT Solvers. In threaded mode Z3 provides leading-edge performance, since speedup is achieved on both SAT and UNSAT instances. </p>
								<h3 class="major">Project-3 Raspberry Pi Wifi Network Configuration</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/helium.jpg" width = "500" height="500" /></span>
								<p>When I first began mining on the helium network, I made steady progress within the project. However, the project's progress came to a halt once I found out that the miners were not able to mine crypto whilst connected to an IPv6 address. This was because Helium's blockchain could not locate the miners specific port, necesarry to execute commands since multiple devices shared the same address. As a result, around 90% of the time crypto would not be mined. To solve this problem I took Raspberry pis and configured the wifi settings, within the pis, in order to forward all information to the newly assigned Ipv4 addresses, ports and mac addresses needed to execute Proof of witnesses <br>(wifi->pi->ethernet->miner)<br> After the change was made the miners total daily crypto earned increased dramatically and equated to almost 70 United States dollars a day!! </p>

								<h3 class="major">Undergrad VLSI System Design Research</h3>
								<p>I am currently working as a Reserach Assitant at the University of South Florida's SEES Lab. My research focuses on formal verification which validates VLSI Systems. Our main methods of research include the use of SAT/SMT Solvers which uses discrite math with a syntax that is derived from a python Library named Z-3. My research specifically focuses on Bounded Model Checks which helps <a href="https://github.com/sees-usf/BMC-Z3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> automate the needed verification techniques </a> in order for multi thread programs to run and cooperate efficiently via SAT/SMT Solvers. As a result, threaded mode Z-3 provides leading-edge performance for mult-threaded programs, allowing speedup to be achieved on both SAT and UNSAT instances.</p> 
								<h3 class="major">Founder of 3xclusivecollectibles LLC</h3>
								<p>Before I started my research efforts I ran a full time business which revolved around the resale of consumer products on Amazon and Ebay, alot of the everyday processes were extremley repetitive for me so I included Python and Golang scripts in order to automate a majority of the businesses daily operations from inventory management, to acquistion of inventory, and automated messaging to customers who ordered past same day shipping times. This allowed the business to expand nearly ten fold and generate 40 grand in sales in two months> However, due to University I have been forced to shut down the Ebay and Amazon portions of my LLC but moved all of the company's focus and captial towards crypto mining which takes very little of my time, because as with Ebay and Amazon I automated most of the process through the use of rasberry pis. This was because Helium's blockchain could not locate the miners specific port, necesarry to execute commands since multiple devices shared the same address. As a result, around 90% of the time crypto would not be mined. To solve this problem I took Raspberry pis and configured the wifi settings, within the pis, in order to forward all information to the newly assigned Ipv4 addresses, ports and mac addresses needed to execute Proof of witnesses <br> (wifi->pi->ethernet->miner) <br> After the change was made the miners total daily crypto earned increased dramatically and equated to almost 70 United States dollars a day!!</p>
								<h3 class="major">Intern at Medserv Construction</h3>
								<p>Lastly, I worked as an Intern for Medserv Construction LLC whcih involved designing and building the comapny's website via AWS, which included the implemetation of a contact form using AWS lambda which helps MedServ save money as containers are only created and used when the user makes requests. Lastly I converted client information from an excel sheet to a dyanmic database using DynamoDB and S3.</p>
